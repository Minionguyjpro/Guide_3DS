### Required Reading
[hShop](https://hshop.erista.me/) is a Homebrew application which allows to install Homebrew, games and other stuff for free directly from your 3DS. It is like the eShop and is a working alternative to the earlier [FreeShop](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/FreeShop_3DS). It will also come in handy for the coming years, because the Nintendo eShop stops for the Nintendo 3DS in March 2023.

{% capture notice-6 %}
hShop offers many of Nintendo's games for the Nintendo 3DS for free. However, this is officially not approved by Nintendo and it will never be. Please be aware of this, before installing any of the paid stuff for free that Nintendo originally offered.
